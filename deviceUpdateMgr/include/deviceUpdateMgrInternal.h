/** @defgroup IARM_BUS IARM-Sys Manager API
*   @ingroup IARM_RDK
*
*  IARM-Bus is a platform agnostic Inter-process communication (IPC) interface. It allows
*  applications to communicate with each other by sending Events or invoking Remote
*  Procedure Calls. The common programming APIs offered by the RDK IARM-Bus interface is
*  independent of the operating system or the underlying IPC mechanism.
*
*  Two applications connected to the same instance of IARM-Bus are able to exchange events
*  or RPC calls. On a typical system, only one instance of IARM-Bus instance is needed. If
*  desired, it is possible to have multiple IARM-Bus instances. However, applications
*  connected to different buses will not be able to communicate with each other.
