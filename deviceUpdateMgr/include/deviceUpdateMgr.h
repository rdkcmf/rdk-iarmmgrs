// Device Update Manager API
//
// Name: iarm_device_update.h
// Date: 07/24/14
// Author: Sal
//
// This file contains the IARM API definition used by the Device Update Manager, the Device Update Proxy and, potentially,
// an Update Master to find, negotiate, and execute updating an image on a device.
//
// ** Entities **
//
// Device Update Manager - The primary module that is responsible for discovering and managing updating images on various
//                         devices.  On initialization or at some configured times, the Device Update manager will scan
//                         the update sub-filesystem of the rootfs for new images and announce the found images on the IARM
//                         bus.  This can be extended to communicating with a server to identify updates on an update server
//                         that can be pulled down and announced. The Device Update Manager will also be able to aggregate
//                         data about devices that are downloaded and downloaded sessions that are executed.  It will be
//                         able to gate when downloads go to devices and when they are loaded on devices.  And it will be
//                         able to officiate between multiple Device Update Proxy's requesting downloads over low bandwidth
//                         or highly utilized mediums.
//
// Device Update Proxy - Each class of devices will have a single Device Update Proxy responsible for managing updates to
//                       its child devices.  A Device Update Proxy can represent multiple devices as long as they are in
//                       the same class. An example of this is remote controls. The Device Update Proxy will be responsible
//                       for listening for announcements and accepting updates for specific devices that are ready for an
//                       update.  It is assumed the Device Update Proxy will know the version of devices it managers and can
//                       either contact them to notify them of the update or receive polls from them asking about an update.
//                       The Device Update Proxy is responsible for understanding the physical transport connecting devices
//                       to the STB and whether downloads to those devices must be serialized or can be parallelized (and
//                       how many can be parallelized). The Device Update Manager can also restrict parallelized downloads
//                       across the same or different transports. The Device Update Proxy is responsible for accepting
//                       download and load events, informing on the status of these events and negotiating the download with
//                       the device over the device specific protocol.
//
// Update Master - The system can be figured with a config file to allow the Device Update Manager to fully manage device
//                 update activities or to have a third entity, called the Update Master, to initiate either/or downloads
//                 and loads. An example of an Update Master would be a UI which would query the user if they wanted to
//                 load and/or download the code. In a typical usage, the UI would gate on the download, then perform an
//                 immediate download followed by an automatic load or would perform a background download followed by a
//                 gated load.
//
// ** IDs **
//
// deviceID - ID of a particular device marked for download by its Device Update Proxy. The device ID is assigned by the
//            Device Update Proxy and is unique only within that Device Update Proxy.
//
// updateSessionID - The update of a particular image tied to a particular device is described and tracked by the
//                   updateSessionID. All calls after an update has been accepted for a device is tracked by this
//                   session ID.
//
// ** Standard Call/Event sequences **

//
// 1) Device Update Manager performs check and finds new device image in update sub-filesystem in the rootfs.
// 2) Device Update Manager sends an ANNOUNCE event with details of the new image
// 3) The Device Update Proxy receives the Announce, decides a device it manages needs it and calls AcceptUpdate to
//    register its intent with the Device Update Manager and get an updateSessionID.
// 4) When the Device Update Proxy negotiates with its managed device that a download is ready and confirms the device
//    is ready and able to receive the download, it sends the READY_TO_DOWNLOAD event with all of the relevant information
//    about the download it is taking.
// 5) The Device Update Manager sends a DOWNLOAD_INITIATE event to begin the download with backgroundDownload set to true.
// 6) The Device Update Proxy sends DOWNLOAD_STATUS events back for 0, the requested percent increments, and finally 100.
// 7) If, say, its 8 PM, the Device Update Manager sends a LOAD_INITIATE event with a timeToLoad of 25200 and a timeAfterInactive
//    of 300 seconds which will put the download happening at 3 AM and after 5 minute of inactivity (just in case the user is
//    still using it.
// 8) At 3:05 AM (presumably and approximately), the device begins the load causing the Device Update Proxy to send a LOAD_STATUS
//    of BEGIN. The device does what it needs to do to load the new image, notifying the Device Update Proxy when done, which then
//    sends ao LOAD_STATUS of END. This will complete the session.

//    is ready and able to receive the download, it sends the READY_TO_DOWNLOAD event with all of the relevant information
//    about the download it is taking.
// 5) A UI agent would be listening for this event and would pop up a window asking the user if he wants to download X update
//    for Y device.
// 6) The user would click yes and the UI agent would send a DOWNLOAD_INITIATE event to begin the download with backgroundDownload
//    set to false with increments as desired to update status bar on the screen.
// 7) The Device Update Proxy sends DOWNLOAD_STATUS events back for 0, the requested percent increments, and finally 100. The UI
//    agent would receive these events and update the status bar on the screen appropriately (also accounting there will be a load
//    at the end).
// 8) When the Device Update Manager sees the 100% DOWNLOAD_STATUS, it would send a LOAD_INITIATE event with a timeToLoad of 0 and
//    a timeAfterInactive of 0 causing the load to Immediately happen
// 9) The device immediately begins the load causing the Device Update Proxy to send a LOAD_STATUS
//    of BEGIN. The device does what it needs to do to load the new image, notifying the Device Update Proxy when done, which then
//    sends ao LOAD_STATUS of END. This will complete the session.

//               If the LoadDelayType is LOAD_NORMAL then the device must wait timeToLoad seconds where the load does
